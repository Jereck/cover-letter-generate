Dear Whomever it may concern,

I saw your ad on Indeed and I feel like I would be a perfect fit
for the Software Engineer, Machine Learning position at Google. I have been teaching myself
software development over the last 3 years, but my passion for programming
started many years ago when I was a sophmore in high school and took my first
C++ class. 

My passion was sparked again when I moved out to Washington state and was looking
for ways to make some extra cash. My journey started out in web development languages;
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. As time went on I hardened my skills as a web developer
doing freelance projects and projects for friends and family. I also dove deeper into other
languages such as Python, C#, Ruby (Rails), and other web frameworks.

Since there, I have continued down the rabbit-hole and started expanding my skills in other
programming avenues. I ended up settling my focus on the Python language, not only for its ease,
but also its strength and power to do just about anything! This cover letter was even 
automated by a Python program I wrote! I have also been using Machine Learning in my currrent
career just for fun to automate ABC (Antecedent - Behavior - Consequence) data.

I would love to talk with you in person about my soft skills as a team player, self-motivator, 


I look forward to hearing from you,
    Jake Reck
